COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: Vivekananda Survi

INTERN ID: C0DF169

DOMAIN: Artificial Intelligence Markup Language

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

## Overview
This project implements a **text generation model** using **GPT or LSTM**, capable of producing **coherent paragraphs** on specific topics based on user prompts. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can generate **human-like text** with contextual relevance, making it useful for creative writing, chatbots, content generation, and more.

## Features
-  **Generates coherent and topic-specific paragraphs** based on user input.
-  **Uses GPT or LSTM-based neural networks** for high-quality text generation.
-  **Customizable model settings** for text length, temperature, and creativity.
-  **Pre-trained and fine-tuned models** for enhanced performance.
-  **Notebook-based implementation** with real-time text generation examples.

## Technologies Used
-  **Python** – Core programming language.
-  **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep learning framework for LSTM-based models.
-  **Hugging Face Transformers** – GPT-based text generation.
-  **NLTK & spaCy** – Preprocessing tools for text cleaning.
-  **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive workspace for experimentation.
